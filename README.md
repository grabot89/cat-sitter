# cat-sitter
An arduino based IOT catsitter project 

I own two cats and want to be able to monitor their environment while I am away from home whether for a day, overnight stay, or in instances where securing a pet sitter is not feasible. 

To achieve this, I used the Arduino IoT Explore Rev2 kit, supplemented by an dditional Arduino boards.
